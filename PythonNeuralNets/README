Python/numpy neural network implementations for MNIST handwritten digits dataset

Dense Network is almost fully functional
CNN is untested yet

To test you will need:
numpy, tensorflow (to import mnist dataset), matplotlib (to display loss/accuracy... curves)

Do not forget to put the mnist folder in the same path as the script (or edit script with correct path)
